## Gap Analysis: Available Positioning Space

### Unclaimed Territory

2. **Agent Monetization**: Limited focus on helping agents make money vs. just spend
3. **Programmable Payments**: No one emphasizes programmable/smart payment controls
4. **Agent-to-Agent Commerce**: Underexplored compared to human-to-agent payments
5. **Universal Integration**: Cross-platform, cross-wallet integration messaging

### Differentiation Opportunities
1. **"Infrastructure" vs "Network"**: Skyfire owns "network," but "infrastructure" is available
2. **Developer-centric**: Strong opportunity to be the "developer-first" option
3. **Monetization focus**: Help agents earn, not just spend
4. **Programmable/Smart**: Emphasize intelligent payment controls
5. **Universal/Cross-platform**: Integration across all wallets/platforms
