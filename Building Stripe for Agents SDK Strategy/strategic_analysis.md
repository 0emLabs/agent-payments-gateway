# Strategic Analysis: 0em Pivot to "Stripe for AI Agents"

## North Star Metric
**Agent Payment Volume (APV)** - All activities must directly drive APV or be deprioritized.

## Key Strategic Decisions

### 1. Core Positioning
- **Primary Focus**: "Stripe for AI Agents" - payment infrastructure for AI agents
- **Market Opportunity**: Phases 2-3 of agent payments (Human-to-AI and AI-to-Internet payments)
- **Competitive Advantage**: More crypto-native than competitors, experience with stablecoins, faster execution

### 2. Product Deprioritization
- **Inbox Zero**: No longer core product, used only for SDK testing/demos and as first customer
- **Scope Reduction**: Focus on payments infrastructure, eliminate scope creep

### 3. Team Structure Reorganization
**Payments/SDK Core Team (80% focus):**
- Affaan, Ojas, David, Jude, Ansel

**Inbox Zero (experimental, 20% focus):**
- Kevin, Esfand, Han (as bandwidth allows)

## Three Main Priority Areas

### Priority 1: Universal Token Counter + Cost/Purchase Optimization
**Owners**: Ansul / Jude (supporting with DevOps)
- **KYA (Know Your Agent)**: Agent Identity Registry linking each agent to verified human identity
- **Token tracking and cost optimization**
- **Integration with existing infrastructure**

### Priority 2: Agent Payment Infrastructure (Core Engine)
**Owners**: Dawid / Ojas
- **Wallet Setup**: Streamlined, crypto-free experience powered by USDC
- **Wallet Linking**: Links crypto wallets to AI agents, reuses existing infrastructure
- **Spending Controls**: Configurable limits and behavior management for agents
- **Agent Purchasing Flow**: Seamless UX enabling agents to make purchases
- **Infrastructure Reuse**: Components from CrossMint and Coinbase Dev Kit

### Priority 3: Developer SDK + Dashboard (User-Facing Experience)
**Owners**: Sami / Affaan
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Cost tracking with predictive insights and smart suggestions
- **Payments SDK**: Add payment capabilities to any agent with just a few lines of code
- **Universal Token Counter integration**
- **Analytics and usage tracking**

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### SDK Strategy
- **Lightweight**: npm-installable, testable independently
- **Structure**: Thin client-side helper with type definitions, UI conveniences, API client
- **Revenue Model**: Platform fee (2.5%) collected server-side in Cloudflare Worker
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed SDK, closed-source backend logic

### Infrastructure Changes
- **Repository Restructure**: Decouple front-end, workers, and services
- **SDK Repository**: New `agent-payments-sdk` repo for all payments logic
- **DevOps**: Short-term rotation among team, mid-term dedicated resource consideration

### Integration Approach
- **Wallet Integration**: Move away from Privy, integrate with user's choice (Coinbase, MetaMask, etc.)
- **Authorization**: Delegation for wallet control when interacting with dapp
- **Outsourcing**: Leverage existing infrastructure rather than building from scratch

## Market Positioning

### Competitive Landscape
- **Skyfire**: KYA/KYC for agents, limited website integrations
- **Crossmint**: NFT to agent payments pivot, lacks focus
- **Catena Labs**: Circle co-founder, AI-native banking stack, partnering with Skyfire

### Differentiation Strategy
- **Crypto-native expertise**: Experience with stablecoins
- **Speed**: Faster execution than incumbents
- **Developer-first**: Easy integration SDK with comprehensive dashboard
- **Agent monetization**: Focus on agent-to-agent payments and programmable spend controls

## Immediate Action Items (From Meetings)

### Technical
- [ ] Create SDK project board (Alexander, Affaan - July 16)
- [ ] Refactor OEM front-end (Jude w/ Affaan sync - Ongoing)
- [ ] Begin SDK testing with mock UIs (Ojas, David - ASAP)
- [ ] Proposal for wallet grant swap (Ojas - July 17)

### Business Development
- [ ] Share Coinbase call questions (All team - July 17)
- [ ] Setup ecosystem tracker/market map (Angela, Jude - July 18)
- [ ] Update OKRs (Everyone - July 16)
- [ ] Finalize whitepaper edits (Ansel - July 19)

### Product Strategy
- [ ] Create dedicated GitHub project board for SDK/payments tasks
- [ ] Simplify daily/weekly updates with clear task owners & timelines
- [ ] Revise OKRs to drop non-core objectives

## Key Insights for Task Creation

1. **APV Alignment**: Every task must directly contribute to Agent Payment Volume
2. **Infrastructure Reuse**: Prioritize leveraging existing solutions over building from scratch
3. **Developer Experience**: Focus on ease of integration and time-to-market
4. **Monetization**: Platform fee model requires server-side enforcement
5. **Trust & Compliance**: KYA/KYC integration critical for adoption
6. **Speed to Market**: Competitive advantage through faster execution
