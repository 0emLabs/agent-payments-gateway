## Test Results Summary

```
Total Test Files: 5
Total Tests: 55
Passing: 50 (91%)
Failing: 5 (9%)
```

## Known Issues

### ContextControllerDO Tests
- Some tests are failing due to mock setup issues with the EncryptionService
- The Durable Object instantiation with mocked dependencies needs refinement

### ParentOrchestratorDO Tests
- The finalization test is failing due to async timing issues with the fetch mock

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Failing Tests**: The failing tests are primarily due to mock configuration issues rather than implementation problems
2. **Complete Pending Tests**: Priority should be given to testing the Gateway Worker and SubAgentWorker
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Critical for testing the queue-based async flow
4. **Add E2E Tests**: Important for validating the complete Slack integration flow

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test src/durable-objects/__tests__/RateLimiterDO.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the mock configuration issues in failing tests
2. Implement tests for Gateway Worker
3. Implement tests for SubAgentWorker
4. Add integration tests for the queue processing flow
5. Create end-to-end tests for the Slack workflow
